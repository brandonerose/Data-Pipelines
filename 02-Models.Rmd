# Models 

about models as a concept.

## What makes a good model?

## Love the data you have

Data is everywhere but you only have access to some of it. Getting access is often time consuming. Once you have access to data you should consistently assess its strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT). In the name of deliverables, you have to have endpoints. Your productivity will be judged by the consistent quality and quantity of work.
